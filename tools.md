# Tools Developed

### PyMerger
**Description**:  
PyMerger is a Python tool designed for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from simulated data of the Einstein Telescope (ET). Leveraging a deep residual neural network (ResNet), PyMerger effectively identifies BBH mergers using data from all three ET sub-detectors.

**Features**:
- **Detection Capability**: Supports BBH merger detection with high accuracy, even at lower SNRs.
- **Versatility**: Can detect BBH events and successfully identify many BNS and BHNS mergers on the ET mock data challange, demonstrating the toolâ€™s potential for broad application in gravitational wave research.
- **Open Source**: Available as a Python package on PyPI and [GitHub](https://github.com/wathela/PyMerger).

**Installation**:
```bash
pip install PyMergers
```


### PyFIRSTClassifier
**Description**:  
PyFIRSTClassifier is a Python package developed for classifying radio galaxy morphology from survey data, particularly from the FIRST radio survey. It utilizes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automate the classification of radio sources into Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley I (FRI), and Fanaroff-Riley II (FRII) types, supporting efficient and scalable analysis of large radio datasets.

**Features**:
- **Automated Classification**: Distinguishes between different radio galaxy morphologies with high accuracy, streamlining data processing for large radio surveys.
- **High Performance**: Achieves 97% overall accuracy, with specific recall rates of 98% for Compact, 100% for Bent, 98% for FRI, and 93% for FRII sources.
- **Open Source**: Available as a Python package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyFIRSTClassifier/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/wathela/FIRST-CLASSIFIER).

**Installation**:
```bash
pip install PyFIRSTClassifier
```
