### 1. PyMerger: Detecting Binary Black Hole Mergers from the Einstein Telescope Using Deep Learning
**Authors**: Wathela Alhassan, T. Bulik, M. Suchenek  
**Published**: 16 December 2024
**Journal**: The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ)  
**DOI**: [10.3847/1538-4357/ad901e](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad901e)

**Summary**:  
PyMerger is a Python tool using a deep residual network (ResNet) for detecting BBH mergers in simulated Einstein Telescope data. The model achieved high detection accuracy across different SNR levels, demonstrating its efficiency for BBH detection and its potential for wider applications in gravitational wave research.

### 2. Detection of Einstein Telescope Gravitational Wave Signals from Binary Black Holes Using Deep Learning
**Authors**: Wathela Alhassan, T Bulik, M Suchenek  
**Published**: 24 December 2022  
**Journal**: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, stac3797  
**DOI**: [10.1093/mnras/stac3797](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac3797)

**Summary**:  
This study leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers in synthetic gravitational wave signals for the Einstein Telescope (ET). Using ResNet, the model achieved high detection accuracy, especially for sources with high SNR, suggesting CNNs as a computationally efficient alternative for near-real-time gravitational wave detection in future ET data.

### 3. The FIRST Classifier: Compact and Extended Radio Sources Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
**Authors**: Wathela Alhassan, Russ Taylor, M. Vaccari  
**Published**: 28 July 2018  
**Journal**: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS), Volume 480  
**DOI**: [10.1093/mnras/sty2038](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty2038)

**Summary**:
This paper introduces the FIRST Classifier, an open-source software that automatically classifies radio sources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) survey into compact and extended (FRI, FRII and BENT) radio sources. In this work, a deep convolutional neural network model was trained to classify radio sources as compact or extended in radio sources. The model demonstrated high accuracy and provides a robust framework for large-scale radio data analysis.

### 4. Planning of Shelter Sites and Evacuation Routes Using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System: Shareq ALneel Locality, Khartoum, Sudan
**Authors**: Wathela Alhassan, Amna Hamid  
**Published**: December 2015  
**Journal**: Journal of Space Science Technologies, Pages 83 to 90  
**URL**: [http://crtean.org.tn/pdf/revu1.pdf](http://crtean.org.tn/pdf/revu1.pdf)

**Summary**:  
This work utilizes remote sensing and GIS to optimize shelter placement and evacuation routes for the Shareq ALneel locality in Khartoum, Sudan. By analyzing terrain and urban infrastructure, the study provides an evidence-based approach for improving disaster response planning and public safety.
